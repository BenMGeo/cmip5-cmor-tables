2012-01-12 : 1.  The long names were corrected for variables o2 in tables Oyr and Omon, and dpocdtpico in table Oyr
2012-01-12 : 2.  The priorities for output from the decadal runs were modified.
2012-01-12 : 3.  The valid_min value for "basin" in the fx table was changed from 1 to 0.
2012-01-12 : 4.  The flag_meanings and flag_values for the "basin" variable in the fx table were transcribed from the excel spreadsheet so that they now will appear in the netCDF output file.
2011-07-24 : 1.  table fx: added thkcello (which also appears in table Omon), which is included in this table to accommodate  models where thkcello is independent of time.  [You are not required to rewrite any files already written that contain "thkcello".]  Alternatively, you may elect to record only 12 monthly-mean values as part of your Omon output if thkcello is independent of time (and in this case all 12 values would be identical).  If you do this, indicate with a comment in the file that the field is actually time-independent for your model.
2011-07-24 : 2.  table Oclim:  In the CMOR dimensions column, removed "olevel" from the list in lines 41-50, which are variables that are independent of ocean level. 
2011-07-04 : 3.  table Omon:  Added 2-d versions of ficeberg, hfrunoffds, hfsnthermds, hfsifrazil, hfsithermds, and hfibtherds for models in which only the vertically integrated amounts are available.
2011-07-24 : 4.  table 3hr:  changed the time-period requested from the abrupt 4xCO2 experiment to be "first 5 years and years 121-150". [The "CFMIP output" spread sheet was modified to be consistent with this.]
2011-07-24 : 5.  table cfDay: for clisccp, changed the order of the dimensions from "longitude latitude tau plev7 time" to "longitude latitude plev7 tau time" to be consistent with the monthly-mean clisccp ordering.  If you have already written the daily clisccp output field, there is no reason to rewrite it.
2011-04-27 : day table has updated comment on wrong standard name
2011-04-27 : fx table has corrected depth axis entry and a bunch of axes that depend on eta
2011-04-11 : added olev axis_entry as vertical coordinate

2011-02-10 : replaced arecella with areacello for sic and sit
2011-01-31 : fixed "depth" stored direction
2011-01-31 : added an experiment
2011-01-31 : new set of Tables from Karl 
2011-01-06 : Changes include the following (note that for all tables, some information formerly appearing in the "comment" column has been moved to the "questions & notes" column, but these changes have not usually been highlighted by shading, which shows the other changes that have been recently made):

dims:
1) units corrected for character string type coordinates.
2) potential density dimension attributes corrected
3) requested coordinate values and bounds corrected for scatratio
4) typo corrected in "requested values of oline strings.

fx:
1) standard_name corrected for Amon surface_snow_and_ice_sublimation_flux
2)  the upward geothermal heat flux has been added to this table, because it normally is independent of time.  Models where it depends on time, should see table Omon.

Oclim, Oyr, and Omon:
1) added request for depth of ocean layers, but only from models where this field cannot be calculated from the vertical coordinate information.

Amon:
1) standard name corrected for surface_snow_and_ice_sublimation_flux
2) cell_methods added to hfgeou
3) added request for 4 new bias-corrected fields, but only from decadal hindcast/prediction experiments.

Lmon:
1) LAI definition corrected

OImon:
1) long_names slightly modified for for rsdssi and rldssi

aero:
1) longname and standard_name modified for sdsdiff and rsdscsdiff
2) standard_name defined for ec550aer

3hr:
1) CMOR dimensions corrected for uas and vas
2) variable name corrected for surface_upwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air_assuming_clear_sky
3) longname modified for rsdsdiff

cfMon:
1) relative_humidity added to this table
2) cell_methods removed from lon and lat fields

2010-11-30 : min/max are adjusted with greater of 5% or 3*std instead of just 3*std
2010-11-30 : typos fixed by Karl
2010-11-30 : formulas do not have indices on coefficients anymore (because of unstructured grids)
2010-11-15 : fixed typo in cfSite longitude/latitude had wrong min/max
2010-11-12 : added site longitude latitude to cfSite, added must_call_cmor_grid attribute, need CMOR 2.5

2010-08-23 : some tweaks from Karl, releasing them along with CMOR 2.1
2010-08-04 : added x/y grid with units of "degrees"
2010-06-09 : tables generated with min/max now being 3 sigma (from 2) and (20% form 5%)
2010-06-01 : table generation was sometimes gen same value for valid_min and valid_max, fixed
2010-06-01 : table generation using %.4g instead of %.2g for valid min/max

2010-05-20 : newer tables

2010-05-11 : updated tables
